# JavaPracticeProject
Java Projects I did to practice specific API or something I found interesting or just something I did to practice coding

The index is ordered by the date that I uploaded each practice project. I often include an explanation of what each program does at the beginning of the file. Comments are also included where I see necessary.

Let the fun begins :D

Index of All Porjects:

1. DirectorySorting.java - A Simple Directory Sorting Program to help you sort your directory by file extension
2. SingletonConstructor.java - Thought process to approach Singleton and demonstrate how to acheive it in a basic way
