# JavaPracticeProject
Java Projects I did to practice - It maybe about some specific API, something/projects I found interesting to do, or just something I did to practice coding.

The index is ordered by the date that I uploaded each practice project. I often include an explanation of what each program does at the beginning of the file. Comments are also included where I see necessary.

Let the fun begins :D
