/* File Sorting program
   
   What does it do?
 	
 	Sorting the directory in according to the extension of the files in the directory
 	
 	Regular files are sorted in according to their extension names
 	Directories are moved into subDir directory/folder
 	After the directory is sorted, a file.lock is created
 	To sort the directory again, delete the file.lock
	
	Special Event:
		a file without an extension name is moved to directory/folder - other
  
 	How is it achievedï¼š
 		1. get file path and validate the file path
 		2. get all files and directories under the path and create a File type Array, File[]
 		3. iterate through the File[] and identify files and directories, then proceed accordingly  
 			
 			3.1 Files
 			3.2 Directories
		
		3.1-Files
			1. get the files extension name
			2. create a directory with the extension name of the file
			3. move the file to the directory
			
		3.2-Directories
			1. create subDir directory
			2. move all directories to the subDir
			
	Last Step:
		create a lock file to show that the sorting has been completed: file.lock
		if the directory has file.lock, the File Sorting program will not run
